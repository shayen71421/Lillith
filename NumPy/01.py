"""
NP is faster than list cuz it uses fixed type
converts data into int32,int 16,int 8 accordign tot the user
meanwhile list uses size,refrence count,ob type,ob value ,so when it goes to binary it is sooooo longggggg 
numpy uses less bytes of memeory so it is fatser to read
no type checking when iterating through objects
it uses contigous memeory,info blocks r not nearby a nd is scattered in list but in numpy  all r next ot each other
Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD)Vector processing can be used when data is nearby
effective cache utilization
it is MATLAB replacement
used for flotting (Mathplottlib)
used for Backend(Pandas,connect $,Digital Photography)
used for machine learning
